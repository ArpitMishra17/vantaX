  },
  {
    question: 'What languages/tools are allowed?',
    answer: 'Any language, any framework, any AI tool. We evaluate your output — not your stack. Use whatever you\'re most productive with.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can non-CS students apply?',
    answer: 'Absolutely. If you can break down a problem and build a solution, your degree doesn\'t matter. VantaX evaluates execution, not credentials.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I participate in multiple challenges?',
    answer: 'Yes. There are 3 challenges across the week — 25, 27, and 29 April, each with a 2-day submission window. You can attempt all three. Each is independent and has its own leaderboard.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What if I lose internet mid-assessment?',
    answer: 'Your timer pauses are not supported — the 2-hour window runs continuously once started. Choose a stable connection. Submissions auto-lock at the deadline.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will I get a certificate?',
    answer: 'All participants receive a VantaX participation credential. Top performers earn the VantaX Verified Builder Badge — a performance-backed credential you can add to LinkedIn.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I retake a challenge?',
    answer: 'No. Each challenge has a single submission window. This isn\'t a practice test — it\'s a hiring audition.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is it free or paid?',
    answer: '₹199 + GST to register. This gives you access to all 3 challenges, structured hiring exposure, and a direct path to participating companies.',
